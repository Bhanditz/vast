Digital Video Ad Serving Template
================================
The IAB’s Video Ad Serving Template (VAST) specification is a universal XML schema for serving ads to digital video players, and describes expected video player behavior when executing VAST-­formatted ad responses. VAST 3.0 adds critical functionality that opens up the in-stream digital video advertising marketplace, reducing expensive technical barriers and encouraging advertisers to increase video ad spend.

For more information about the VAST specification, visit the [Digital Video Ad Serving Template](http://www.iab.net/vast) page on the IAB.net website.
